Test NG-
no main class
notations used.
main notation - @Test--> signifies test case

write n number of method just pass @Test

@before suite
@Before method--- executing before @test 
@AfterMethod-- executing after @test
@Before class
@before test

@Test(Priority=1)---> changes the priority for running test cases

@BeforeMethod and @ Beforeclass will execute after each @test
but @AfterClass and @BeforeClass will execute only after begining and end of the class(after execution of  all the test cases)

object datatype is super data types for int string double etc
data provider needs test cases

benefits:
in build framework
reporting present
parallel method in build in case of threads
no main and other method required-- just @Test
having dataProvider for fetching the data
priority notation present --no need of looping

implicitWait- all elements existence it will check

emplicitwait- search a specific element
no such element for giving wrong class name from dome

xpaths:
relative-- // tagname [attribute name= attribute value]
absolute--/ full xpath
--------------------------------------------------------

create profile i

exit from firefox browser->run->firefox.exe -p

synchronization::

thread wait used for  logs.

implicit wait: presence of elements, not checking properties of elements,used in web page and common to all the elements
explicit wait:waiting for any elements properties,used for each element and its properties
1)clickable
2)enable
explicit wait is benifical


List- findElements - finding all the elements in webpage
wait-- implicit and explicit wait
hover--- use actions

windows- use set to handle multiple windows


xpathaccess- 
from top to bottom
//span[text()='Samsung']/../..//preceding-sibling::li/a/span[text()='Mobiles']--- from bottom to top
//span[text()='Samsung']/parent::*/..//preceding-sibling::li/a/span[text()='Mobiles']

from top to bottom
//span[text()='Mobiles']/../..//following-sibling::li/a/span[text()='Samsung']

conatains -> are used for dynamic elements

drag and drop method

alerts-

no object for interfaces.- alert,javascriptexecuter
object created for classes like webdriver,select,actions

alert/ notification/popup

user will give keyword- serach

add to cart-> men->shirt-> add to cart->  add five products and check add to cart page


javascriptExecuter js = (JavascriotEx)dr;
